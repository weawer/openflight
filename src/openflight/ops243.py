"""
OPS243-A Doppler Radar Driver for Golf Launch Monitor.

This module provides a Python interface to the OmniPreSense OPS243-A
short-range radar sensor over either transport it offers:

- USB CDC-ACM (``/dev/ttyACM*``). The host baud setting is nominal; the
  link is not rate-limited by it.
- The 3.3V UART on the J3 header (``/dev/ttyAMA0`` on a Pi 5). Here baud
  is the real wire rate, the factory default is 19,200, and a 40.6KB I/Q
  dump takes 21s at that rate — so the driver negotiates up to 230,400
  (``I5``) on connect. See ``negotiate_uart_baud``.

Only one transport is live at a time: per AN-010-AD, enumerating USB
silences the UART.

Key specs for golf application:
- Speed accuracy: +/- 0.5%
- Direction reporting (inbound/outbound)
- Detection range: 50-100m (RCS=10), ~4-5m for golf ball sized objects

Recommended golf configuration (per OmniPreSense AN-027):
- 30ksps sample rate (max ~208 mph, sufficient for all golf)
- 128 buffer size
- FFT 4096 (X=32) for ±0.1 mph resolution at ~56 Hz report rate
- Positioning: 6-8 feet behind ball, 10° upward angle

Speed limits by sample rate:
- 10kHz (SX): max 69.5 mph  - too slow for golf
- 20kHz (S2): max 139 mph   - marginal for fast shots
- 30kHz (S=30): max 208 mph - RECOMMENDED for golf
- 50kHz (SL): max 347 mph   - overkill, lower resolution
- 100kHz (SC): max 695 mph  - overkill

        The radar stamps its rolling-buffer trigger on an internal clock
        (``trigger_time``, fractional seconds) that is *immune to USB read
        latency*. To convert that to a host epoch later we need the offset
        ``O = host_epoch - radar_clock``.

        Each read is bracketed by ``time.time()`` before and after a *tight*
        poll for the reply (not the fixed-0.1s ``_send_command`` path), so the
        radar sampled its clock somewhere inside that bracket. ``offset_s`` is
        the bracket midpoint minus the radar clock; ``read_latency_ms`` (the
        bracket width) bounds its uncertainty.

        Some OPS firmware reports ``C?`` in whole seconds while rolling-buffer
        captures report fractional ``trigger_time`` values. Whole-second reads
        are not directly usable because their unknown fractional phase can be
        almost one second off. When the clock is integer-only, this method keeps
        sampling until it observes a one-second rollover and uses that boundary
        to estimate the offset. If no precise sync is available, the summary is
        marked unusable so the trigger path can fall back to first-byte timing.

        Sound-triggered captures use this mapping to convert the radar's
        internal ``trigger_time`` to host epoch only when
        ``usable_for_trigger_timestamps`` is true. Returns a summary dict. By
        default it is also stored on ``self.last_clock_sync``; pass
        ``store=False`` for diagnostics that should not affect the live timing
