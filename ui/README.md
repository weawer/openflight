# OpenFlight UI

The OpenFlight dashboard: a React + TypeScript + Vite app that connects to the
backend over `socket.io`. The kiosk is a tabbed instrument panel (Live, Stats,
Shots, Camera, Profiles, Debug) plus a screen-mounted display mode at `/display`.

This README covers frontend development. For the hardware, the radar pipeline,
and how the whole system fits together, see the [root README](../README.md).

## Quick start

You need Node 22.12 or newer (`electron@44` will not install cleanly on Node 20).

### Frontend-only (recommended for UI work)

Runs Vite plus a Node Socket.IO mock on port `8080` — no Python, hardware, or
`uv` required:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:mock
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. Use **Simulate** to generate shots. The mock
speaks the same Socket.IO events as the real backend (`shot`, `session_state`,
club/profile changes, clear/delete, stub cloud upload and shutdown).

### Against the real / Python mock backend

Start a backend without hardware from the repo root:

```bash
scripts/start-kiosk.sh --mock
```

Then in `ui/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

See the [root README](../README.md#getting-started) for full-stack options.

The Vite server runs on port `5173`. When served there, the UI assumes the
backend is at `http://localhost:8080`. Point it elsewhere with
`VITE_SOCKET_URL`:

```bash
VITE_SOCKET_URL="http://localhost:8081" npm run dev
```

`/api/*` requests from the Vite origin are proxied to `http://localhost:8080`
(so shutdown works under `npm run dev` / `dev:mock`).

## How the UI connects

The app is entirely client-side. Everything flows through one socket connection.

- **`utils/serverOrigin.ts`** resolves the backend origin: `VITE_SOCKET_URL` if
  set, otherwise `http://localhost:8080` when running on the Vite dev port
  (`5173`), otherwise the page's own origin (the production case, where the
  backend serves the built UI).
- **`services/socketService.ts`** owns the connection. It receives events like
  `shot`, `session_state`, `camera_capture_settings`, and `trigger_status`, and
  sends commands like `set_club`, `clear_session`, `simulate_shot`, and
  `set_camera_capture_settings`. Read it before assuming what the
  backend emits. **`mock-server/`** implements that contract in Node for
  `npm run dev:mock`.
- **State** lives in `stores/` (Zustand: shots, system, camera, debug, profiles, …).
- **Shutdown** posts to `/api/shutdown` to stop the connected backend (stubbed
  as a no-op by the Node mock).

### Profiles socket contract

Shots are attributed to a server-owned **profile** — a person or a place — with
a stable id. There is no browser-local roster: the server is the only source of
truth, sent as one snapshot plus five mutations.

Server → client:

- `profiles` — `{ profiles: Profile[], active_profile_id: string }`. Sent on
  connect and after every mutation below. `Profile` is
  `{ id, name, created_at, settings }`.
- `session_cleared` — `{ profile_id: string, shots: Shot[] }`, sent after
  `clear_session`.

Client → server:

- `get_profiles` — request a fresh `profiles` snapshot.
- `set_active_profile` — `{ profile_id }`. Switches which profile new shots
  attribute to.
- `add_profile` — `{ name }`. Creates a profile and makes it active.
- `rename_profile` — `{ profile_id, name }`. Renames in place; the id (and
  every shot already attributed to it) is unchanged.
- `remove_profile` — `{ profile_id }`. The server refuses to remove the active
  profile, the last remaining profile, or a profile that still has session
  shots. Clear that profile's session first.
- `clear_session` — `{ profile_id }` (defaults to the active profile).
  Deletes that profile's shots; other profiles are untouched.

Shots carry `profile_id` and `profile_name` (a snapshot at capture time) for
logging / external consumers. The kiosk UI renders the current profile name
from the `profiles` roster (joined by `profile_id`), so renaming updates the
on-screen name for past shots.

**Kiosk shell.** Footer tabs switch views. The footer logo opens a sheet for
units (MPH/YDS vs KMH/M), dark/light theme, language, and simulator status.
The footer power icon is always visible and opens a
shutdown confirmation. Change club (or training implement) lives on the Live
header. Tap a Live metric to pin it top-left while keeping all metrics visible.
Camera-backed shots add a **Replay** action in the Live header and a play button
in Shots. Selecting either action asks the backend to lazily create and cache a
60 FPS MP4; no video conversion runs automatically after a shot. The full-screen
player includes touch controls, a scrubber, an impact marker, and retryable
preparation/playback errors.

The pin is stored in
`localStorage` under `openflight.hero-metric`. Theme is stored under
`openflight.theme` (default dark). Those keys live in the **current browser
profile**. Electron does not share Chromium's profile; see
[Electron Kiosk Shell](../docs/electron-kiosk-shell.md#browser-local-state-breaking-on-first-electron-launch).

**Display mode** lives at `/display`: a compact, fullscreen-friendly dashboard
for mounted screens and TVs. The [root README](../README.md#tv-display-mode)
covers casting it.

**Launch Daddy** is a hidden overlay. Five taps on the header connection LED
and title toggle it. When on, new shots can fire an animation; tap the brand
mark to turn it off.

Touch and type conventions for the Pi kiosk are in [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

## Languages

UI copy lives in `src/i18n/`. English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese ship
today. Pick a language from the footer menu (**Language** dropdown). The choice
is stored in `localStorage` under `openflight.locale:v1`.

### Add a language

1. Copy `src/i18n/en.ts` to `src/i18n/<code>.ts` (use a short BCP 47 language
   code such as `de` or `ja`).
2. Translate every value. Keep the same keys; TypeScript will fail the build if
   a key is missing.
3. Register it in `src/i18n/index.ts`:
   - Add the id to `LocaleId`.
   - Add `{ id, nativeName, htmlLang }` to `LOCALES` (`nativeName` is the
     language’s own name, shown in the dropdown).
   - Import the catalog and add it to `catalogs`.
4. Run `npm test` — a catalog that drifts from English keys fails.

Do not translate profile names, club tile codes (`7i`, `DR`), or unit
abbreviations (`MPH` / `YDS`).

## Project layout

A few files do most of the work. This is illustrative, not exhaustive —
components carry co-located `.css` and `.test.tsx` files.

```text
src/
  App.tsx                    # tabs, display routing, session wiring
  main.tsx                   # entry point (applies stored theme)
  i18n/                      # EN/ES/FR/PT catalogs
  theme/                     # dark/light tokens
  services/socketService.ts  # socket connection, events, backend commands
  hooks/useSocket.ts         # connects on mount
  utils/serverOrigin.ts      # backend origin resolution
  stores/                    # Zustand (shots, system, camera, profiles, …)
  components/
    panel/                   # Live, Stats, Shots, Camera, Profiles, chrome
    ui/                      # MetricCard, TabBar, Button, SegmentedControl
    DisplayMode.tsx          # /display
    DebugPanel.tsx
    LaunchDaddy/             # hidden overlay
mock-server/                 # Node Socket.IO mock for frontend-only development
```

## Troubleshooting

**Socket won't connect.** Confirm a backend is running on port `8080` (or set
`VITE_SOCKET_URL`). For UI-only work, use `npm run dev:mock`. Connection logs
come from `services/socketService.ts`.

**Build fails.** `npm run build` surfaces TypeScript and bundling errors; `npm
run lint` catches the rest.
