and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **On-screen keyboard for profile names.** Adding or renaming a profile on the
  Pi kiosk now shows a full-screen keyboard. Chromium in `--kiosk` mode does not
  surface a system keyboard, so the native text field was unusable on the
  touchscreen.
- **Clear-session confirmation is a modal again.** The overlay, scrim, and
  centered dialog styles were missing after the class-name rename, so at the
  800×480 kiosk size the prompt rendered as inline page content.
- **Attack angle no longer inflated by 1/cos(club path).** The camera club
  delivery divided vertical speed by the forward component alone instead of the
  full horizontal speed, overstating attack angle on any shot with club path.

### Added
- **Custom-club persistence foundation.** A validated, atomic JSON store now
  supports custom club definitions with stable IDs and configurable loft,
  physics, and display order. Runtime club selection is not yet integrated.
- **PAR-TEE connector.** `"type": "partee"` in `config/sim.json` streams shots
  to the [PAR-TEE](https://playpartee.com) iPhone app over OpenConnect V1 on the
  phone's Wi-Fi address (port 921 by default). Same shared codec as GSPro and
  OpenGolfSim; the header pill and "Sent to" panel read PAR-TEE.
- **Profiles replace players.** Shots are now attributed to a server-owned profile
  (a person *or* a place) with a stable id, persisted to
  `~/.config/openflight/profiles.json` (override with `OPENFLIGHT_PROFILES_PATH`
  or `--profiles-path`). Profiles can be renamed without orphaning their shots.
  Removing a profile is refused while it still has session rows. The socket
  exposes a single authoritative `profiles` snapshot plus
  `set_active_profile` / `add_profile` / `rename_profile` / `remove_profile`.
  Breaking: `set_player` / `player_changed` are gone, `Shot.player_name` is replaced
  by `profile_id` + `profile_name`, and existing browser-local player rosters are
  discarded.
- **Automatic OV9281 exposure control.** High-speed camera capture now measures
  the impact area every five seconds, restores the last known-good setting at
  startup, and selects a shutter/gain combination that preserves club contrast
  without excessive clipping or motion blur. Large lighting changes re-enter
  fast convergence while smaller changes require confirmation. Camera-derived
  shot analysis is withheld when lighting is unsuitable, but radar processing
  and shot display continue normally with an operator-facing lighting warning.
- **Instrument-panel kiosk UI.** The dashboard is a tabbed shell (Live, Stats,
  Shots, Camera, Profiles, Debug) instead of the previous stacked shot and stats
  views. Tap a Live metric to pin it top-left while keeping all ten metrics
  visible. The footer logo opens units, dark/light theme, language, simulator,
  and ball-detection status; a persistent footer power button opens the shutdown
  confirmation. Club (or training implement) selection is a Live header action.
  See the [UI README](https://github.com/jewbetcha/openflight/blob/main/ui/README.md).
- **Kiosk languages.** English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. Choice is
  stored in `localStorage` (`openflight.locale:v1`).
- **Dark and light themes.** Toggle in the footer menu; stored as
  `openflight.theme` (default dark).
- **Synchronized OV9281 high-speed camera capture.** OpenFlight can now retain
  pre- and post-impact camera frames from the shared sound trigger, align them
  with OPS243 and IWR6843 captures, and use camera-assisted or camera-only
  fallbacks for horizontal launch, club path, and angle of attack. The Camera
  tab adds live alignment, crop, orientation, and lighting controls while the
  rolling buffer remains armed. See [OV9281 Camera](camera/README.md).
- **On-demand camera shot replay.** Camera-backed shots can open a 60 FPS
  slow-motion impact player from Live or Shots, with touch controls, scrubbing,
  and a trigger-frame impact marker. MP4 conversion starts only after a manual
  Replay selection, caches the result beside the raw capture, and reports
  retryable preparation or playback failures without affecting shot results.
- **Battery and external-power status for Raspberry Pi UPS boards.** OpenFlight
  can now display charging state and battery percentage, issue dismissible 20%
  and 10% warnings while discharging, and record throttled power telemetry in
  session logs. Enable the initial Geekworm X1202/X1206 provider with
  `--battery geekworm`; monitoring remains disabled when no provider is
  selected. The accompanying Pi setup installs native Linux power-supply
  telemetry and optional taskbar capacity support without enabling automatic
  shutdown or charging control. See [Battery Monitoring](using/battery.md).
- **System Prerequisites:** Documented missing binary dependencies (`swig`, `liblgpio-dev`, `python3-dev`) required prior to executing `./scripts/setup/setup.sh`.
- **Environment Reload Guidance:** Added instructions for reloading terminal environment variables (`source ~/.bashrc`) when installed dependencies or scripts (`setup.sh`, `start-kiosk.sh`) are not recognized in the current terminal session.
- **Configurable IWR6843 capture compression.** One firmware image can now
  switch at runtime between the recommended 24-frame, 3 ms, 53-bin IQ16
  profile and an advanced 36-frame, 2 ms, 32-bin IQ8 profile. Both retain the
  same 72 ms shot movie and all 3 TX x 4 RX channels. Per-frame range windows,
  timing, and IQ8 scales are carried in the dump so offline and live processing
  use the actual capture geometry. The dense profile uses a sparse scale
  preview to sustain the 2 ms HWA rearm budget and exposes missed frames,
  overruns, and clipped components through firmware `stats`.
- **OPS243 over the Raspberry Pi GPIO UART.** The radar can now run on the J3
  header instead of USB, which frees the Pi's USB power budget for the TI angle
  radar. Baud is the real wire rate on that transport and the factory default of
  19,200 would stretch a 40.6KB dump to 21 seconds, so the driver probes for the
  rate the board is actually using and raises it to 230,400 (`I5`), bringing a
  dump down to ~1.8 seconds. Every dump timeout now scales with the negotiated
  rate, so a link that settles low runs slowly instead of truncating captures.
  Pass `--radar-port /dev/ttyAMA0` (and optionally `--ops-baud`); USB behaviour
  is unchanged. `diagnose.py --ops-port` adds a preflight for the three
  UART-only failures that all look like an unresponsive radar — missing device
  node, a login console holding the port, and the OPS USB cable still plugged in
  (which silences the UART). See
  [Moving the OPS243 from USB to the Pi GPIO UART](build/ops243-uart.md).
- **Flash IWR6843 firmware directly from a Raspberry Pi.** Contributors no
  longer need an Intel Mac, UniFlash, or TI Cloud Agent for routine firmware
  updates. The guided terminal workflow verifies the image hash, offers a
  non-destructive bootloader probe, erases the existing image, transfers the
  replacement in acknowledged chunks, and requires the radar's ROM bootloader
  to verify the completed image. The current IWR6843LEVM still requires its
  physical flash-mode switch and reset button.
- **Experimental three-transmitter capture for horizontal launch direction.**
  The TX2 firmware variant captures all three transmitters while retaining the
  TX1/TX3 vertical array, giving the offline and live pipelines the antenna
  diversity needed to begin measuring left/right start direction.
- **On-chip range snapshots for smaller IWR6843 shot captures.** The radar uses
  its hardware accelerator and EDMA to retain 53 selected complex range-FFT
  bins in moving early, middle, and late windows instead of every raw ADC
  sample. The production ring keeps 18 frames at 4 ms spacing in a 549,542-byte
  dump while preserving vertical and horizontal processing inputs.
- **`--kld7` now delivers the full launch-angle pipeline by default.** Enabling
  the K-LD7 radars turns on the **two-ray multipath vertical launch-angle
  estimator** (per-frame demodulation that separates the ball from its floor
  reflection to recover true elevation instead of averaging across the
  multipath) plus the **ball-speed cosine correction** (OPS radial → true
  speed). Each shot is graded into a tour-derived Tier-1/Tier-2 confidence with
  a tour-average boost for suppressed reads; measurements that clear the
  physics guard but trip a soft consistency guard are shown as **marginal
  (one-dot) confidence** rather than silently replaced by the club estimate.
  Far-net flights are de-aliased past the FSK range wrap (`--net-distance`).
- `--kld7-mount-tilt` is **required** with `--kld7` (measure with a phone
  inclinometer — no safe default). `--kld7-angle-offset` defaults to the
  calibrated `1.5`.
- `--calculated-spin` (opt-in, off by default): replaces radar spin with the
  kinematic estimate `170·v·sin(LA)^1.2`; the measured value is retained in
  `spin_rpm_measured` for scoring.
- `--kld7-vertical-raw` test mode surfaces the raw radar angle for every shot
  (all display guards bypassed).
- **Club path from the IWR6843's pre-impact frames.** `Shot.club_path_deg` has
  been wired end to end since the K-LD7 era but unpopulated since that radar
  was deprecated. It now comes from the six pre-impact frames the L3-dump
  firmware already retains. The estimator fits `x(t)` and `y(t)` in Cartesian
  coordinates and reports `path = atan2(v_y, v_x)`; absolute azimuth enters
  additively rather than cancelling out, so a constant per-element phase error
  from the shipped array calibration (measured on a different board) shifts
  the reported path by a constant rather than the estimator itself — which is
  what `--iwr6843-azimuth-offset-deg` is for. Measured on a first-principles
  fixture across ±12°, absolute error grows with angle (0.034° at 4° to
  0.303° at −12°, roughly symmetric), so it separates deliberate in-to-out
  from out-to-in swings but does not support degree-level claims. Ships
  experimental; validate with `scripts/iwr6843/club_path_report.py` before
  trusting it.

### Changed
- Club physics and simulation defaults now lives in one immutable registry
- Core server, session logging, kiosk startup, and UI code now share canonical
  shot/session helpers and omit redundant compatibility paths.
- Session JSONL format version is now 2 after consolidating trigger and shot
  entries and removing obsolete entry types.
- Display mode (`/display`) now uses the same metric cards and theme tokens as
  the kiosk Live view.
- The vertical estimator is now a fixed cascade (two_ray → geometry →
  single-frame geometry → naive); it is no longer user-selectable. Launch-angle
  source and confidence semantics changed accordingly.

### Removed
- Deprecated integrated-camera detection, obsolete K-LD7 experiment/replay
  tooling, unused session-log writers, and their redundant tests and controls.
- `--kld7-vertical-estimator` (estimator is a fixed cascade), `--kld7-geometry`
  (kiosk preset), and `--ball-speed-cosine-correction` (folded into `--kld7`).
  `--kld7-bypass-vertical-gate` renamed to `--kld7-vertical-raw`.

### Fixed
- Kiosk startup no longer exits when the optional Alloy service is unavailable,
  and it rebuilds the UI bundle before launching the server.
- **Graceful IWR6843 shutdown.** Kiosk shutdown now asks the server to finish
  hardware cleanup before escalating to process signals. An active TI dump is
  allowed to complete, capture firmware is stopped and verified inactive, and
  the serial port is then closed. This prevents an interrupted L3 transfer or
  failed GPIO setup from leaving the radar unresponsive on the next startup.
- **Raspberry Pi 5 & OS Compatibility:** Updated UART configuration documentation to support Debian Bookworm and Raspberry Pi 5 hardware using `dtparam=uart0=on` alongside legacy `enable_uart=1`.
- **UART Diagnostic Commands:** Simplified UART verification instructions in `docs/iwr6843/README.md` and `docs/ops243-uart-migration.md` using `grep -E` to check for both legacy and modern device-tree parameters simultaneously across config paths.
- Session logging: serialize all access to the session JSONL file with a
  lock. The `log_*` methods are called concurrently from the OPS243
  capture thread, the K-LD7 stream thread, and Flask-SocketIO handlers;
  without synchronization, large entries (e.g. `rolling_buffer_capture`
  with 2×4096 samples) could interleave and corrupt JSONL lines, and a
  write could race `end_session()` closing the file (`AttributeError` /
  `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file`). Corrupt lines break the
  offline replay tooling that depends on these logs.
- IWR6843 runtime: the ball-estimate call passed a hardcoded
  `tdm_sign_policy="positive"` instead of the runtime's configurable field
  (the club-path fallback already honored the field, and offline replay
  plumbs a caller-supplied policy end to end). Any non-default policy
  silently produced different live-vs-replay answers for the same capture.
  Live behavior with the default is unchanged.
- **GPIO startup on a Raspberry Pi 5.** Anything using the sound-trigger GPIO —
  the IWR6843 capture monitor and the GPIO sound trigger — died with
  `BadPinFactory: Unable to load any default pin factory!`. The cause is
  upstream: gpiozero 2.0.1.post2 (the latest release) calls `os.path.exists`
  in its lgpio chip auto-detection without importing `os`, and that code path
  only runs on a Pi 5, so gpiozero swallows the `NameError` and every remaining
  backend then fails for its own reason. OpenFlight now selects the lgpio
  factory itself with an explicit gpiochip, which skips the broken branch.
  `OPENFLIGHT_GPIO_CHIP` overrides the chip if a kernel update renumbers the
  header. Note that `GPIOZERO_PIN_FACTORY=lgpio` was never a workaround — it
  forces the same failing call.
- IWR6843 range-snapshot capture now freezes only at a completed ring boundary
  and correctly rearms the HWA/EDMA chain, preventing partial or one-shot-only
  captures during repeated shots.
- K-LD7 tracker: shots could silently lose their launch angle when the
  stream thread appended a frame while the shot path iterated the ring
  buffer (`snapshot_buffer` / `_radc_frames_for_extraction`). CPython
  raises `RuntimeError: deque mutated during iteration` for this, and
  the server's broad K-LD7 exception handler swallowed it, so the shot
  was reported without an angle and no error was visible. Buffer reads
  now copy under a lock; appends and resets take the same lock.
- **One collapsed channel no longer drags the launch angle down.** The vertical
  estimator averaged its two channel estimates unweighted. On a 0.229 m, 5.5°
  mount the `two8` channel collapsed to about 0° on five of six shots while
  `four4_path_tdm` read 15.3–22.0°, so five 7-irons that actually launched near
  17° were reported at 7–9°, each stamped with 0.95 confidence while
  `component_std_deg` sat at 8–10° in the log. Across a seven-shot session the
  plain mean read 10.9° with one channel collapsed; channel selection recovers
  18.3°. Channels that disagree beyond 8° now resolve to the better-supported
  one with reduced confidence; channels that agree are still averaged.
- **Launch-angle confidence is derived instead of hardcoded.** Both the vertical
  and horizontal angles reported a constant 0.95. The horizontal case computed
  HLCMF-v0 coherence, logged it, and then discarded it in favour of the
  constant, so five estimates whose own channels disagreed by 8–10° were
  presented as high confidence. Vertical confidence now follows channel
  agreement and corroboration, horizontal follows coherence, and `spin_axis_deg`
  gates on the horizontal leg rather than appearing the moment club path exists.
- **Track-span floor relaxed from 18 ms to 15 ms, and the span is now logged.**
  Recovers usable captures — one range session went from 6/7 accepted at a
  10.9° mean to 7/7 at 18.3°, and the 18 ms → 15 ms change is what recovered
  the seventh shot. The span is now recorded, since it was the gate rejecting
  most shots and was invisible without an offline replay.
- **A channel that measured nothing can no longer win the channel selection.**
  Objective curvature scored 0 both when a channel's minimum was genuinely
  flat and when its minimum sat on the edge of the −5° to 45° search grid —
  two different things, since an edge minimum means the true angle lies
  outside the searched range and a real launch above 45° pins a perfectly
  healthy channel there. Curvature now returns "no measurement" for an edge
  minimum, and such a channel takes no part in selection, in the spread
  comparison, or in the reported `component_std_deg`. When the channels
  disagree and none has positive curvature — all flat, all off-grid, or
  unscored — the shot is rejected as `rejected_no_conditioned_channel`
  instead of returning whichever channel came first in the dictionary, which
  was `two8`, the one that collapses.
- **The `fast_*` estimates no longer veto corroboration they cannot win.** All
  five components fed the agreement comparison while only the two channel
  models could be selected, so one `fast_*` outlier pushed the spread past
  the 8° gate and cut two channels agreeing to 0.4° down to a single channel
  flagged as uncorroborated and derated. They are diagnostic-only: still
  logged in `components_deg`, now excluded from the selection decision and
  from `component_std_deg`. Affects raw-ADC captures only — range-snapshot
  captures never computed the fast-time models.

### Known Limitations

Deferred pending a session paired with a reference instrument. See
[the IWR6843 operator guide](iwr6843/calibration.md#launch-angle-estimator-limitations).

- **The calibration tilt sweep cannot recommend a tilt.** It minimises
  `component_std_deg`, which is monotonic in tilt across the swept window, so
  its minimum lands on a window edge instead of the mount angle: on the
  2026-07-25 session, with the mount measured at 5.5°, a ±3° sweep returned
  2.5° on two shots and 8.5° on two others. Set tilt by physical measurement.
- **The curvature criterion is not scale-normalised.** `four4_path_tdm`'s
  objective range is 2–4× larger than `two8`'s, so most of the "3.7–10.7×
  sharper" margin is model scale — on one shot the true margin is 1.14×. It is
  validated as a degeneracy detector, not an accuracy ranker, and it is
  one-sided: a collapsed `four4_path_tdm` would likely still win.
- **Selecting is worse than averaging when both channels are healthy but
  disagree.** Monte Carlo at 6° of noise: 4.26° RMS averaging against 5.79°
  selecting, 7.93° on the disagreeing subset. The 8° gate's justification is a
  gap between one shot at 4.59° and six at 15.9–20.2°, from a single session,
  club, geometry and tilt.

### Changed
- Spin detection: drop the autocorrelation override branch. The autocorr
  peak inside the envelope search region often lands at minimum lag
  (~12000 RPM / upper rail) by spectral coincidence, which previously
  flipped legitimate mid-range FFT seam picks to the upper rail and got
  them rejected as bandpass-shoulder noise. The autocorr fallback still
  *confirms* the FFT pick when the two agree within 10%; disagreements
  are now logged for diagnostics but never replace the FFT result.
- Spin detection: lower `SPIN_SNR_MIN` from 3.0 → 2.5 so marginal but
  real seam tones are reported at low confidence instead of dropped.

### Added
- `scripts/analysis/replay_club_speed.py`: offline replay of a proposed
  MEDIAN club-speed picker against any session log. Builds the same
  candidate set the production picker uses, applies a 30 % magnitude
  floor, and reports the median speed for each `rolling_buffer_capture`
  alongside the originally logged (magnitude-pick) value, with smash
  factors as a physical sanity check. The script is exploratory and
  does not change production behaviour — it lets us inspect what a
  median-based picker would have produced before committing to a code
  change.
- `scripts/analysis/plot_spin_debug.py`: 4-panel diagnostic for a single
  `rolling_buffer_capture` (speed timeline, raw I/Q, bandpass envelope,
  envelope FFT spectrum) to inspect what the spin algorithm saw and why
  it accepted or rejected a shot.
- K-LD7 shot-correlation analysis workflow and theory writeup
  - `scripts/analyze_kld7.py --pair-shots` for offline club-to-ball pairing on `.pkl` captures
