    above ~1.25), which would mean lift pulling the ball down and drag
    *accelerating* it. Sp is recomputed every integration step from
    r*omega/v, and v decays faster than spin, so a normal lob wedge reaches
    Sp ~1.5 near apex - inside the negative-drag region. Holding both curves
    at their end value is the guard; these tests are what make its removal
