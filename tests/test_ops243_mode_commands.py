"""OPS243-A mode commands must match the current API reference.

AN-010-AD (API Commands, p21) is authoritative on mode control:

    GS  CW Mode            Sets CW operation only          (OPS243-A default)
    GC  Rolling Buffer     Sets Rolling Buffer Mode on (GS to disable),
                           *previously was G1*

The older AN-027 Rolling Buffer app note still documents the pre-rename
G1/G0 pair, and a swing-speed branch once renamed the whole driver to match
it -- silently reverting the production launch-monitor path to deprecated
mnemonics. These tests pin the byte sequences so the two docs can't be
confused again, and so swing-speed training stays off the rolling-buffer
path entirely.
