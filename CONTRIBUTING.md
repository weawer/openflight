# Contributing to OpenFlight

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenFlight! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Node.js 22.12 or newer (for UI development; CI uses the version in `.node-version`)
- Git
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager (required)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jewbetcha/openflight.git
   cd openflight
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   make install
   ```

   This installs Python dependencies (including dev tools) and UI dependencies.

   Or manually:
   ```bash
   uv sync --group dev
   cd ui && npm install
   ```

3. **Install pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   make hooks
   ```

   This runs ruff, pylint, and ESLint automatically before each commit.

4. **Build the UI** (for frontend development)
   ```bash
   make build-ui
   ```

### Running in Development

```bash
# Run server in mock mode (no hardware needed)
make dev

# Or manually:
scripts/start-kiosk.sh --mock

# Run UI development server (separate terminal)
cd ui && npm run dev
```

## Code Quality Standards

All checks can be run at once with:

```bash
make lint
```

### Python

We use **pylint** for linting with a minimum score of **9.0** and **ruff** for formatting.

```bash
# Check code quality
uv run pylint src/openflight/

# Auto-format with ruff
make format
```

### TypeScript/React

Use the checked-in [UI color palette](docs/development/color-palette.md) when adding or
changing visual states.

```bash
cd ui
npm run lint      # ESLint
npm run build     # Type check + build
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_launch_monitor.py -v

# Run with coverage (if pytest-cov installed)
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src/openflight --cov-report=html
```

**All tests must pass before submitting a PR.**

## Submitting Changes

### Reporting Issues

Use the [issue templates](https://github.com/jewbetcha/openflight/issues/new/choose) to file bugs, request features, or get help with hardware setup. Check existing issues before creating new ones.

### Pull Request Requirements

Every pull request **must** meet all three of the following requirements. PRs that
do not will be asked for changes before review.

1. **Scoped to a single feature or fix with a clear story.**
   A PR should do one thing. The description must explain *what* the change is and
   *why it was required* — the problem it solves or the need it meets. If you catch
   yourself writing "and also…", split the work into separate PRs.

2. **Includes automated tests.**
   New behavior needs new tests; bug fixes need a test that reproduces the bug
   (see [Development Rules](CLAUDE.md) — write the failing test first). If you
   believe tests genuinely don't apply, say so explicitly in the PR and explain why.

3. **Describes the manual (human) testing performed.**
   Automated tests aren't enough. Document what *you* verified by hand: what you ran
   (mock mode, real hardware, specific UI flows), what you observed (numbers,
   screenshots), and which edge cases you exercised. "Tests pass" is not manual
   testing.

These requirements are enforced automatically by the **PR Checks** workflow, which
will fail if:

- a required PR description section (why it was required, automated tests, manual
  testing) is left empty;
- source code under `src/openflight/` or `ui/src/` changes without any accompanying
  test changes — add the `no-tests-needed` label (and explain why in the description)
  for the rare PR where tests genuinely don't apply;
- UI code under `ui/src/` changes but the description contains no images — add
  screenshots of the change (drag and drop them into the description), or add the
  `no-screenshots-needed` label (and explain why) if the change has no visible effect;
- the PR title doesn't follow the conventional format
  `<type>(optional scope): <description>` (allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`,
  `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, `style`, `revert`), e.g.
  `feat(kld7): add launch angle smoothing`.

### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** with clear, focused commits, scoped to a single feature or fix

3. **Add automated tests** covering the new behavior or reproducing the fixed bug

4. **Ensure quality checks pass**
   ```bash
   make test
   make lint
   cd ui && npm run build
   ```

5. **Manually test your change** and note what you verified by hand

6. **Update documentation** if needed
   - Update README.md for user-facing changes
   - Update relevant docs in `docs/`
   - Add entry to `docs/CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`

7. **Submit a pull request** and fill out the PR template — including the automated
   tests, manual testing, and "why it was required" sections

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
Add ball detection indicator to UI header

- Create BallDetectionIndicator component
- Add shot data to useSocket hook
- Update App.tsx to display indicator
```

### What We're Looking For

**High-priority contributions:**
- Bug fixes with tests
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Test coverage improvements

**Feature ideas:**
- Launch angle detection improvements
- Better carry distance models
- Mobile app / Bluetooth support
- Integration with golf simulation software

## Testing Without Hardware

OpenFlight supports **mock mode** for development without hardware:

```bash
make dev
```

The `MockLaunchMonitor` class simulates realistic shot data based on TrackMan averages.
